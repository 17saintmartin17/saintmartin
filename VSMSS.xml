        <Heading0>﻿PREFACE TO DESIDERIUS.</Heading0>
    </row>
    <row>
        <Heading0><name>SEVERUS</name> to his dearest brother <name>Desiderius</name> sendeth greeting. I had determined, 
            my like-minded brother, to keep private, and confine within the walls of my own house, 
            the little treatise which I had written concerning the life of <name>St. Martin</name>. I did so, as 
            I am not gifted with much talent, and shrank from the criticisms of the world, lest 
            (as I think will be the case) my somewhat unpolished style should displease my readers, 
            and I should be deemed highly worthy of general reprehension for having too boldly laid 
            hold of a subject which ought to have been reserved for truly eloquent writers. But I have 
            not been able to refuse your request again and again presented. For what could there be which 
            I would not grant in deference to your love, even at the expense of my own modesty? However, 
            I have submitted the work to you on the sure understanding that you will reveal it to no other, 
            having received your promise to that effect. Nevertheless, I have my fears that you will become 
            the means of its publication to the world; and I well know that, once issued, it can never[1] be 
            recalled. If this shall happen, and you come to know that it is read by some others, you will, I 
            trust, kindly ask the readers to attend to the facts related, rather than the language in which they 
            are set forth. You will beg them not to be offended if the style chances unpleasantly to affect their 
            ears, because the <place>kingdom of God</place> consists not of eloquence, but faith. Let them also bear in mind that 
            salvation was preached to the world, not by orators, but by fishermen, although <name>God</name> could certainly 
            have adopted the other course, had it been advantageous. For my part, indeed, when I first applied my 
            mind to writing what follows, because I thought it disgraceful that the excellences of so great a man 
            should remain concealed, I resolved with myself not to feel ashamed on account of solecisms of language. 
            This I did because I had never attained to any great knowledge of such things; or, if I had formerly some 
            taste of studies of the kind, I had lost the whole of that, through having neglected these matters for so 
            long a course of time. But, after all, that I may not have in future to adopt such an irksome mode of 
            self-defense, the best way will be that the book should be published, if you think right, with the 
            author's name suppressed. In order that this may be done, kindly erase the title which the book bears 
            on its front, so that the page may be silent; and (what is quite enough) let the book proclaim its subject-matter,
            while it tells nothing of the author.</Heading0>

        <Heading0>Reasons for writing the Life of <name>St. Martin</name>.</Heading0>
    </row>
    <row>
        <Heading0>MOST men being vainly devoted to the pursuit of worldly glory, have, as they imagined, acquired 
            a memorial of their own names from this source; viz. devoting their pens to the embellishment of the 
            lives of famous men. This course, although it did not secure for them a lasting reputation, still has 
            undoubtedly brought them some fulfilment of the hope they cherished. It has done so, both by preserving 
            their own memory, though to no purpose, and because, through their having presented to the world the 
            examples of great men, no small emulation has been excited in the bosoms of their readers. Yet, 
            notwithstanding these things, their labors have in no degree borne upon the blessed and never-ending 
            life to which we look forward. For what has a glory, destined to perish with the world, profited those 
            men themselves who have written on mere secular matters? Or what benefit has posterity derived from 
            reading of <name>Hector</name> as a warrior, or <name>Socrates</name> as an expounder of philosophy? There can be no profit in 
            such things, since it is not only folly to imitate the persons referred to, but absolute madness not 
            to assail them with the utmost severity. For, in truth, those persons who estimate human life only by 
            present actions, have consigned their hopes to fables, and their souls to the tomb. In fact, they gave 
            themselves up to be perpetuated simply in the memory of mortals, whereas it is the duty of man rather 
            to seek after eternal life than an eternal memorial and that, not by writing, or fighting, or philosophizing, 
            but by living a pious, holy, and religious life. This erroneous conduct of mankind, being enshrined in 
            literature, has prevailed to such an extent that it has found many who have been emulous either of the 
            vain philosophy or the foolish excellence which has been celebrated. For this reason, I think I will 
            accomplish something well worth the necessary pains, if I write the life of a most holy man, which shall 
            serve in future as an example to others; by which, indeed, the readers shall be roused to the pursuit of 
            true knowledge, and heavenly warfare, and divine virtue. In so doing, we have regard also to our own advantage, 
            so that we may look for, not a vain remembrance among men, but an eternal reward from <name>God</name>. For, although we 
            ourselves have not lived in such a manner that we can serve for an example to others, nevertheless, we have 
            made it our endeavor that he should not remain unknown who was a man worthy of imitation. I shall therefore 
            set about writing the life of <name>St. Martin</name>, and shall narrate both what he did previous to his episcopate, and 
            what he performed as a bishop. At the same time, I cannot hope to set forth all that he was or did. Those 
            excellences of which he alone was conscious are completely unknown, because, as he did not seek for honor 
            from men, he desired, as much as he could accomplish it, that his virtues should be concealed. And even of 
            those which had become known to us, we have omitted a great number, because we have judged it enough if only 
            the more striking and eminent should be recorded. At the same time, I had in the interests of readers to see 
            to it that, no undue amount of instances being set before them should make them weary of the subject. But I 
            implore those who are to read what follows to give full faith to the things narrated, and to believe that I 
            have written nothing of which I had not certain knowledge and evidence. I should, in fact, have preferred to 
            be silent rather than to narrate things which are false.[2]</Heading0>

        <Heading0>Military Service of St. Martin.</Heading0>
    </row>
    <row>
        <Heading0><name>MARTIN</name>, then, was born at <place>Sabaria</place>[3] in <place>Pannonia</place>, but was brought up at <place>Ticinum</place>,[4] which is 
            situated in <place>Italy</place>. His parents were, according to the judgment of the world, of no mean rank, but were 
            heathens. His father was at first simply a soldier, but afterwards a military tribune. He himself in his 
            youth following military pursuits was enrolled in the imperial guard, first under <name>king Constantine</name>, and 
            then under <name>Julian Cæsar</name>. This, however, was not done of his own free will, for, almost from his earliest 
            years, the holy infancy of the illustrious boy aspired rather to the service of <name>God</name>.[5] For, when he was 
            of the age of ten years, he betook himself, against the wish of his parents, to the Church, and begged that 
            he might become a catechumen. Soon afterwards, becoming in a wonderful manner completely devoted to the 
            service of <name>God</name>, when he was twelve years old, he desired to enter on the life of a hermit; and he would have 
            followed up that desire with the necessary vows, had not his as yet too youthful age prevented. His mind, 
            however, being always engaged on matters pertaining to the monasteries or the Church, already meditated in 
            his boyish years what he afterwards, as a professed servant of <name>Christ</name>, fulfilled. But when an edict was 
            issued by the ruling powers[6] in the state, that the sons of veterans should be enrolled for military 
            service, and he, on the information furnished by his father, (who looked with an evil eye on his blessed actions) 
            having been seized and put in chains, when he was fifteen years old, was compelled to take the military oath, 
            then showed himself content with only one servant as his attendant. And even to him, changing places as it were, 
            he often acted as though, while really master, he had been inferior; to such a degree that, for the most part, 
            he drew off his [servant's] boots and cleaned them with his own hand; while they took their meals together, 
            the real master, however, generally acting the part of servant. During nearly three years before his baptism, 
            he was engaged in the profession of arms, but he kept completely free from those vices in which that class of 
            men become too frequently involved. He showed exceeding kindness towards his fellow-soldiers, and held them in 
            wonderful affection; while his patience and humility surpassed what seemed possible to human nature. There is 
            no need to praise the self-denial which he displayed: it was so great that, even at that date, he was regarded 
            not so much as being a soldier as a monk. By all these qualities he had so endeared himself to the whole body 
            of his comrades, that they esteemed him while they marvelously loved him. Although not yet made a new creature[7] 
            in <name>Christ</name>, he, by his good works, acted the part of a candidate for baptism. This he did, for instance, by aiding 
            those who were in trouble, by furnishing assistance to the wretched, by supporting the needy, by clothing the naked, 
            while he reserved nothing for himself from his military pay except what was necessary for his daily sustenance. 
            Even then, far from being a senseless hearer of the Gospel, he so far complied with its precepts as to take no 
            thought about the morrow.</Heading0>

    </row>
    <row>
        <Heading0>ACCORDINGLY, at a certain period, when he had nothing except his arms and his simple military dress, in the 
            middle of winter, a winter which had shown itself more severe than ordinary, so that the extreme cold was proving 
            fatal to many, he happened to meet at the gate of the city of <place>Amiens</place>[8] a poor man destitute of clothing. He was 
            entreating those that passed by to have compassion upon him, but all passed the wretched man without notice, 
            when <name>Martin</name>, that man full of <name>God</name>, recognized that a being to whom others showed no pity, was, in that respect, 
            left to him. Yet, what should he do? He had nothing except the cloak in which he was clad, for he had already 
            parted with the rest of his garments for similar purposes. Taking, therefore, his sword with which he was girt, 
            he divided his cloak into two equal parts, and gave one part to the poor man, while he again clothed himself with 
            the remainder. Upon this, some of the by-standers laughed, because he was now an unsightly object, and stood out 
            as but partly dressed. Many, however, who were of sounder understanding, groaned deeply because they themselves 
            had done nothing similar. They especially felt this, because, being possessed of more than <name>Martin</name>, they could have 
            clothed the poor man without reducing themselves to nakedness. In the following night, when <name>Martin</name> had resigned himself 
            to sleep, he had a vision of <name>Christ</name> arrayed in that part of his cloak with which he had clothed the poor man. He 
            contemplated the <name>Lord</name> with the greatest attention, and was told to own as his the robe which he had given. Ere long, 
            he heard <name>Jesus</name> saying with a clear voice to the multitude of angels standing round -- "Martin, who is still but a 
            catechumen, clothed[9] me with this robe." The <name>Lord</name>, truly mindful of his own words (who had said when on earth -- 
            "Inasmuch[10] as ye have done these things to one of the least of these, ye have done them unto me"), declared that 
            he himself had been clothed in that poor man; and to confirm the testimony he bore to so good a deed, he condescended 
            to show him himself in that very dress which the poor man had received. After this vision the sainted man was not puffed 
            up with human glory, but, acknowledging the goodness of <name>God</name> in what had been done, and being now of the age of twenty years, 
            he hastened to receive baptism. He did not, however, all at once, retire from military service, yielding to the entreaties 
            of his tribune, whom he admitted to be his familiar tent-companion.[11] For the tribune promised that, after the period of
            his office had expired, he too would retire from the world. <name>Martin</name>, kept back by the expectation of this event, continued, 
            although but in name, to act the part of a soldier, for nearly two years after he had received baptism.</Heading0>

    </row>
    <row>
        <Heading0>IN the meantime, as the barbarians were rushing within the two divisions of <place>Gaul</place>, 
            <name>Julian Cæsar</name>,[12] bringing an army together at the city[13] of the <place>Vaugiones</place>, began to distribute 
            a donative to the soldiers. As was the custom in such a case, they were called forward, one by one, 
            until it came to the turn of <name>Martin</name>. Then, indeed, judging it a suitable opportunity for seeking his 
            discharge--for he did not think it would be proper for him, if he were not to continue in the service, 
            to receive a donative--he said to <name>Cæsar</name>, "Hitherto I have served you as a soldier: allow me now to become 
            a soldier to <name>God</name>: let the man who is to serve thee receive thy donative: I am the soldier of <name>Christ</name>: it 
            is not lawful for me to fight." Then truly the tyrant stormed on hearing such words, declaring that, from 
            fear of the battle, which was to take place on the morrow, and not from any religious feeling, <name>Martin</name> 
            withdrew from the service. But <name>Martin</name>, full of courage, yea all the more resolute from the danger that 
            had been set before him, exclaims, "If this conduct of mine is ascribed to cowardice, and not to faith, 
            I will take my stand unarmed before the line of battle tomorrow, and in the name of the ´<name>Lord Jesus</name>, 
            protected by the sign of the cross, and not by shield or helmet, I will safely penetrate the ranks of 
            the enemy." He is ordered, therefore, to be thrust back into prison, determined on proving his words 
            true by exposing himself unarmed to the barbarians. But, on the following day, the enemy sent ambassadors 
            to treat about peace and surrendered both themselves and all their possessions. In these circumstances who 
            can doubt that this victory was due to the saintly man? It was granted him that he should not be sent unarmed 
            to the fight. And although the good <name>Lord</name> could have preserved his own soldier, even amid the swords and darts 
            of the enemy, yet that his blessed eyes might not be pained by witnessing the death of others, he removed all 
            necessity for fighting. For <name>Christ</name> did not require to secure any other victory in behalf of his own soldier, 
            than that, the enemy being subdued without bloodshed, no one should suffer death.</Heading0>

        <Heading0><name>Martin</name> converts a Robber to the Faith.</Heading0>
    </row>
    <row>
        <Heading0>FROM that time quitting military service, Martin earnestly sought after the society of <name>Hilarius</name>, 
            bishop of the city <name>Pictava</name>,[14] whose faith in the things of <name>God</name> was then regarded as of high renown, 
            and in universal esteem. For some time <name>Martin</name> made his abode with him. Now, this same <name>Hilarius</name>, having 
            instituted him in the office of the diaconate, endeavored still more closely to attach him to himself, 
            and to bind him by leading him to take part in Divine service. But when he constantly refused, crying 
            out that he was unworthy, <name>Hilarius</name>, as being a man of deep penetration, perceived that he could only be 
            constrained in this way, if he should lay that sort of office upon him, in discharging which there should 
            seem to be a kind of injury done him. He therefore appointed him to be an exorcist. <name>Martin</name> did not refuse 
            this appointment, from the fear that he might seem to have looked down upon it as somewhat humble. Not long 
            after this, he was warned in a dream that he should visit his native land, and more particularly his parents, 
            who were still involved in heathenism, with a regard for their religious interests. He set forth in accordance 
            with the expressed wish of the <name>holy Hilarius</name>, and, after being adjured by him with many prayers and tears, that 
            he would in due time return. According to report <name>Martin</name> entered on that journey in a melancholy frame of mind, 
            after calling the brethren to witness that many sufferings lay before him. The result fully justified this prediction. 
            For, first of all, having followed some devious paths among the <place>Alps</place>, he fell into the hands of robbers. And when one 
            of them lifted up his axe and poised it above <name>Martin</name>'s head, another of them met with his right hand the blow as it fell; 
            nevertheless, having had his hands bound behind his back, he was handed over to one of them to be guarded and stripped. 
            The robber, having led him to a private place apart from the rest, began to enquire of him who he was. Upon this, <name>Martin</name> 
            replied that he was a Christian. The robber next asked him whether he was afraid. Then indeed <name>Martin</name> most courageously 
            replied that he never before had felt so safe, because he knew that the mercy of the <name>Lord</name> would be especially present 
            with him in the midst of trials. He added that he grieved rather for the man in whose hands he was, because, by living 
            a life of robbery, he was showing himself unworthy of the mercy of <name>Christ</name>. And then entering on a discourse concerning 
            Evangelical truth, he preached the word of <name>God</name> to the robber. Why should I delay stating the result? The robber believed; 
            and, after expressing his respect for <name>Martin</name>, he restored him to the way, entreating him to pray the <name>Lord</name> for him. 
            That same robber was afterwards seen leading a religious life; so that, in fact, the narrative I have given above is 
            based upon an account furnished by himself.</Heading0>

        <Heading0><name>MARTIN</name>, then, having gone on from thence, after he had passed <place>Milan</place>, 
            the <name>devil</name> met him in the way, having assumed the form of a man. The <name>devil</name> first asked him 
            to what place he was going. <name>Martin</name> having answered him to the effect that he was minded to 
            go whithersoever the <name>Lord</name> called him, the <name>devil</name> said to him, "Wherever you go, or whatever 
            you attempt, the <name>devil</name> will resist you." Then <name>Martin</name>, replying to him in the prophetical word, 
            said, "The <name>Lord</name> is my helper; I will not fear what man can do unto me."[15] Upon this, his enemy 
            immediately vanished out of his sight; and thus, as he had intended in his heart and mind, he 
            set free his mother from the errors of heathenism, though his father continued to cleave to its evils. 
            However, he saved many by his example.</Heading0>

        <Heading0>After this, when the Arian heresy had spread through the whole world, and was especially powerful in <place>Illyria</place>, 
            and when he, almost single-handed, was fighting most strenuously against the treachery of the priests, and had been 
            subjected to many punishments (for he was publicly scourged, and at last was compelled to leave the city), again 
            betaking himself to <place>Italy</place>, and having found the Church in the two divisions of <place>Gaul</place> in a distracted condition 
            through the departure also of the holy <name>Hilarius</name>, whom the violence of the heretics had driven into exile, he 
            established a monastery for himself at <name>Milan</name>. There, too, <name>Auxentius</name>, the originator and leader of the Arians, 
            bitterly persecuted him; and, after he had assailed him with many injuries, violently expelled him from the city. 
            Thinking, therefore, that it was necessary to yield to circumstances, he withdrew to the island <place>Gallinaria</place>,[16] 
            with a certain presbyter as his companion, a man of distinguished excellences. Here he subsisted for some time on 
            the roots of plants; and, while doing so, he took for food hellebore, which is, as people say, a poisonous kind of grass. 
            But when he perceived the strength of the poison increasing within him, and death now nearly at hand, he warded off the 
            imminent danger by means of prayer, and immediately all his pains were put to flight. And not long after having discovered 
            that, through penitence on the part of the king, permission to return had been granted to <name>holy Hilarius</name>, he made an effort 
            to meet him at <place>Rome</place>, and, with this view, set out for that city.</Heading0>

        <Heading0><name>Martin</name> restores a Catechumen to Life.</Heading0>
    </row>
    <row>
        <Heading0>AS <name>Hilarius</name> had already gone away, so <name>Martin</name> followed in his footsteps; and having 
            been most joyously welcomed by him, he established for himself a monastery not far from the 
            town. At this time a certain catechumen joined him, being desirous of becoming instructed in 
            the doctrines[17] and habits of the most holy man. But, after the lapse only of a few days, 
            the catechumen, seized with a languor, began to suffer from a violent fever. It so happened 
            that <name>Martin</name> had then left home, and having remained away three days, he found on his return 
            that life had departed from the catechumen; and so suddenly had death occurred, that he had 
            left this world without receiving baptism. The body being laid out in public was being honored 
            by the last sad offices on the part of the mourning brethren, when <name>Martin</name> hurries up to them 
            with tears and lamentations. But then laying hold; as it were, of the Holy Spirit, with the 
            whole powers of his mind, he orders the others to quit the cell in which the body was lying; 
            and bolting the door, he stretches himself at full length on the dead limbs of the departed 
            brother. Having given himself for some time to earnest prayer, and perceiving by means of 
            the <name>Spirit of God</name> that power was present,[18] he then rose up for a little, and gazing on 
            the countenance of the deceased, he waited without misgiving for the result of his prayer 
            and of the mercy of the <name>Lord</name>. And scarcely had the space of two hours elapsed, when he saw 
            the dead man begin to move a little in all his members, and to tremble with his eyes opened 
            for the practice of sight. Then indeed, turning to the <name>Lord</name> with a loud voice and giving thanks, 
            he filled the cell with his ejaculations. Hearing the noise, those who had been standing at the 
            door immediately rush inside. And truly a marvelous spectacle met them, for they beheld the man 
            alive whom they had formerly left dead. Thus being restored to life, and having immediately obtained 
            baptism, he lived for many years afterwards; and he was the first who offered himself to us both as 
            a subject that had experienced the virtues[19] of <name>Martin</name>, and as a witness to their existence. The 
            same man was wont to relate that, when he left the body, he was brought before the tribunal of the 
            Judge, and being assigned to gloomy regions and vulgar crowds, he received a severe[20] sentence. 
            Then, however, he added, it was suggested by two angels of the Judge that he was the man for whom 
            <name>Martin</name> was praying; and that, on this account, he was ordered to be led back by the same angels, 
            and given up to <name>Martin</name>, and restored to his former life. From this time forward, the name of the 
            sainted man became illustrious, so that, as being reckoned holy by all, he was also deemed powerful and truly apostolical.</Heading0>

        <Heading0>NOT long after these events, while <name>Martin</name> was passing by the estate of a certain man 
            named <name>Lupicinus</name>, who was held in high esteem according to the judgment of the world, he was 
            received with shouting and the lamentations of a wailing crowd. Having, in an anxious state 
            of mind gone up to that multitude, and enquired what such weeping meant, he was told that one 
            of the slaves of the family had put an end to his life by hanging. Hearing this, <name>Martin</name> entered 
            the cell in which the body was lying, and, excluding all the multitude, he stretched himself upon 
            the body, and spent some little time in prayer. Ere long, the deceased, with life beaming in his 
            countenance, and with his drooping eyes fixed on <name>Martin</name>'s face, is aroused; and with a gentle 
            effort attempting to rise, he laid hold of the right hand of the saintly man, and by this means 
            stood upon his feet. In this manner, while the whole multitude looked on, he walked along with 
            <name>Martin</name> to the porch of the house.</Heading0>

        <Heading0>High Esteem in which <name>Martin</name> was held.</Heading0>
    </row>
    <row>
        <Heading0>NEARLY about the same time, <name>Martin</name> was called upon to undertake the episcopate of 
            the church at <place>Tours</place>;[21] but when he could not easily be drawn forth from his monastery, 
            a certain <name>Ruricius</name>, one of the citizens, pretending that his wife was ill, and casting 
            himself down at his knees, prevailed on him to go forth. Multitudes of the citizens having 
            previously been posted by the road on which he traveled, he is thus under a kind of guard 
            escorted to the city. An incredible number of people not only from that town, but also from 
            the neighboring cities, had, in a wonderful manner, assembled to give their votes.[22] There 
            was but one wish among all, there were the same prayers, and there was the same fixed opinion 
            to the effect that <name>Martin</name> was most worthy of the episcopate, and that the church would be 
            happy with such a priest. A few persons, however, and among these some of the bishops, who 
            had been summoned to appoint a chief priest, were impiously offering resistance, asserting 
            forsooth that <name>Martin</name>'s person was contemptible, that he was unworthy of the episcopate, that 
            he was a man despicable in countenance, that his clothing was mean, and his hair disgusting. 
            This madness of theirs was ridiculed by the people of sounder judgment, inasmuch as such objectors 
            only proclaimed the illustrious character of the man, while they sought to slander him. Nor truly 
            was it allowed them to do anything else, than what the people, following the Divine will, desired[23] 
            to be accomplished. Among the bishops, however, who had been present, a certain one of the name <name>Defensor</name> 
            is said to have specially offered opposition; and on this account it was observed that he was at the time 
            severely censured in the reading from the prophets. For when it so happened that the reader, whose duty it 
            was to read in public that day, being blocked out by the people, failed to appear, the officials falling 
            into confusion, while they waited for him who never came, one of those standing by, laying hold of the 
            Psalter, seized upon the first verse which presented itself to him. Now, the Psalm ran thus: "Out of 
            the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise because of thine enemies, that thou 
            mightest destroy the enemy and the avenger."[24] On these words being read, a shout was raised by 
            the people, and the opposite party were confounded. It was believed that this Psalm had been chosen 
            by Divine ordination, that <name>Defensor</name>[25] might hear a testimony to his own work, because the praise 
            of the <name>Lord</name> was perfected out of the mouth of babes and sucklings in the case of <name>Martin</name>, while the 
            enemy was at the same time both pointed out and destroyed.</Heading0>

    </row>
    <row>
        <Heading0>AND now having entered on the episcopal office, it is beyond my power fully 
            to set forth how <name>Martin</name> distinguished himself in the discharge of its duties. For 
            he remained with the utmost constancy, the same as he had been before. There was the 
            same humility in his heart, and the same homeliness in his garments. Full alike of 
            dignity and courtesy, he kept up the position of a bishop properly, yet in such a way 
            as not to lay aside the objects and virtues of a monk. Accordingly he made use, for some 
            time, of the cell connected with the church but afterwards, when he felt it impossible 
            to tolerate the disturbance caused by the numbers of those visiting it, he established 
            a monastery for himself about two miles outside the city. This spot was so secret and 
            retired that he enjoyed in it the solitude of a hermit. For, on one side, it was surrounded 
            by a precipitous rock of a lofty mountain, while the river <place>Loire</place> had shut in the rest of the 
            plain by a bay extending back for a little distance; and the place could be approached only 
            by one, and that a very narrow passage. Here, then, he possessed a cell constructed of wood. 
            Many also of the brethren had, in the same manner, fashioned retreats for themselves, but 
            most of them had formed these out of the rock of the overhanging mountain, hollowed into 
            caves. There were altogether eighty disciples, who were being disciplined after the example 
            of the saintly master. No one there had anything which was called his own; all things were 
            possessed in common. It was not allowed either to buy or to sell anything, as is the custom 
            among most monks. No art was practiced there, except that of transcribers, and even this was 
            assigned to the brethren of younger years, while the elders spent their time in prayer. Rarely 
            did any one of them go beyond the cell, unless when they assembled at the place of prayer. 
            They all took their food together, after the hour of fasting was past. No one used wine, except 
            when illness compelled them to do so. Most of them were clothed in garments of camels' hair.[26] 
            Any dress approaching to softness[27] was there deemed criminal, and this must be thought the 
            more remarkable, because many among them were such as are deemed of noble rank. These, though 
            far differently brought up, had forced themselves down to this degree of humility and patient 
            endurance, and we have seen numbers of these afterwards made bishops. For what city or church 
            would there be that would not desire to have its priests from among those in the monastery of <name>Martin</name>?</Heading0>

        <Heading0><name>Martin</name> demolishes an Altar consecrated to a Robber.</Heading0>
    </row>
    <row>
        <Heading0>BUT let me proceed to a description of other excellences which <name>Martin</name> displayed as a 
            bishop. There was, not far from the town, a place very close to the monastery, which a false 
            human opinion had consecrated, on the supposition that some martyrs had been buried together 
            there. For it was also believed that an altar had been placed there by former bishops. But 
            <name>Martin</name>, not inclined to give a hasty belief to things uncertain, often asked from those who 
            were his elders, whether among the presbyters or clerics, that the name of the martyr, or the 
            time when he suffered, should be made known to him. He did so, he said, because he had great 
            scruples on these points, inasmuch as no steady tradition respecting them had come down from 
            antiquity. Having, therefore, for a time kept away from the place, by no means wishing to 
            lessen the religious veneration with which it was regarded, because he was as yet uncertain, 
            but, at the same time not lending his authority to the opinion of the multitude, lest a mere 
            superstition should obtain a firmer footing, he one day went out to the place, taking a few 
            brethren with him as companions. There standing above the very sepulchre, <name>Martin</name> prayed to 
            the <name>Lord</name> that he would reveal, who the man in question was, and what was his character or 
            desert. Next turning to the left-hand side, he sees standing very near a shade of a mean 
            and cruel appearance. <name>Martin</name> commands him to tell his name and character. Upon this, he 
            declares his name, and confesses his guilt. He says that he had been a robber, and that he 
            was beheaded on account of his crimes; that he had been honored simply by an error of the 
            multitude; that he had nothing in common with the martyrs, since glory was their portion, 
            while punishment exacted its penalties from him. Those who stood by heard, in a wonderful way, 
            the voice of the speaker, but they beheld no person. Then <name>Martin</name> made known what he had seen, 
            and ordered the altar which had been there to be removed, and thus he delivered the people from 
            the error of that superstition.</Heading0>

    </row>
    <row>
        <Heading0>NOW, it came to pass some time after the above, that while <name>Martin</name> was going 
            a journey, he met the body of a certain heathen, which was being carried to the tomb 
            with superstitious funeral rites. Perceiving from a distance the crowd that was approaching, 
            and being ignorant as to what was going on, he stood still for a little while. For there was 
            a distance of nearly half a mile between him and the crowd, so that it was difficult to discover 
            what the spectacle he beheld really was. Nevertheless, because he saw it was a rustic gathering, 
            and when the linen clothes spread over the body were blown about by the action of the wind, he 
            believed that some profane rites of sacrifice were being performed. This thought occurred to him, 
            because it was the custom of the Gallic rustics in their wretched folly to carry about through 
            the fields the images of demons veiled with a white covering. Lifting up, therefore, the sign of 
            the cross opposite to them, he commanded the crowd not to move from the place in which they were, 
            and to set down the burden. Upon this, the miserable creatures might have been seen at first to 
            become stiff like rocks. Next, as they endeavored, with every possible effort, to move forward, 
            but were not able to take a step farther, they began to whirl themselves about in the most ridiculous 
            fashion, until, not able any longer to sustain the weight, they set down the dead body. Thunderstruck, 
            and gazing in bewilderment at each other as not knowing what had happened to them, they remained sunk 
            in silent thought. But when the saintly man discovered that they were simply a band of peasants celebrating 
            funeral rites, and not sacrifices to the gods, again raising his hand, he gave them the power of going away, 
            and of lifting up the body. Thus he both compelled them to stand when he pleased, and permitted them to 
            depart when he thought good.</Heading0>

        <Heading0><name>Martin</name> escapes from a Falling Pine-tree.</Heading0>
    </row>
    <row>
        <Heading0>AGAIN, when <place>in a certain village</place> he had demolished a very ancient temple, 
            and had set about cutting down a pine-tree, which stood close to the temple, the 
            chief priest of that place, and a crowd of other heathens began to oppose him. 
            And these people, though, under the influence of the <name>Lord</name>, they had been quiet 
            while the temple was being overthrown, could not patiently allow the tree to be 
            cut down. <name>Martin</name> carefully instructed them that there was nothing sacred in the 
            trunk of a tree, and urged them rather to honor <name>God</name> whom he himself served. He 
            added that there was a moral necessity why that tree should be cut down, because 
            it had been dedicated to a demon. Then one of them who was bolder than the others 
            says, "If you have any trust in thy <name>God</name>, whom you say you worship, we ourselves 
            will cut down this tree, and be it your part to receive it when falling; for if, 
            as you declare, your <name>Lord</name> is with you, you will escape all injury." Then <name>Martin</name>, 
            courageously trusting in the <name>Lord</name>, promises that he would do what had been asked. 
            Upon this, all that crowd of heathen agreed to the condition named; for they held 
            the loss of their tree a small matter, if only they got the enemy of their religion 
            buried beneath its fall. Accordingly, since that pine-tree was hanging over in one 
            direction, so that there was no doubt to what side it would fall on being cut, <name>Martin</name>, 
            having been bound, is, in accordance with the decision of these pagans, placed in that 
            spot where, as no one doubted, the tree was about to fall. They began, therefore, to 
            cut down their own tree, with great glee and joyfulness, while there was at some distance 
            a great multitude of wondering spectators. And now the pine-tree began to totter, and to 
            threaten its[28] own ruin by falling. The monks at a distance grew pale, and, terrified 
            by the danger ever coming nearer, had lost all hope and confidence, expecting only the 
            death of <name>Martin</name>. But he, trusting in the <name>Lord</name>, and waiting courageously, when now the 
            falling pine had uttered its expiring crash, while it was now falling, while it was just 
            rushing upon him, simply holding up his hand against it, he put in its way the sign of 
            salvation. Then, indeed, after the manner of a spinning-top (one might have thought it 
            driven[29] back), it swept round to the opposite side, to such a degree that it almost 
            crushed the rustics, who had taken their places there in what was deemed a safe spot. 
            Then truly, a shout being raised to heaven, the heathen were amazed by the miracle, 
            while the monks wept for joy; and the name of <name>Christ</name> was in common extolled by all. 
            The well-known result was that on that day salvation came to that region. For there 
            was hardly one of that immense multitude of heathens who did not express a desire for 
            the imposition of hands, and abandoning his impious errors, made a profession of faith 
            in the <name>Lord Jesus</name>. Certainly, before the times of <name>Martin</name>, very few, nay, almost none, 
            in those regions had received the name of <name>Christ</name>; but through his virtues and example 
            that name has prevailed to such an extent, that now there is no place thereabouts which 
            is not filled either with very crowded churches or monasteries. For wherever he destroyed 
            heathen temples, there he used immediately to build either churches or monasteries.</Heading0>

    </row>
    <row>
        <Heading0>NOR did he show less eminence, much about the same time, in other 
            transactions of a like kind. For, having in a <place>certain village</place> set fire to 
            a very ancient and celebrated temple, the circle of flames was carried by 
            the action of the wind upon a house which was very close to, yea, connected 
            with, the temple. When <name>Martin</name> perceived this, he climbed by rapid ascent to 
            the roof of the house, presenting himself in front of the advancing flames. 
            Then indeed might the fire have been seen thrust back in a wonderful manner 
            against the force of the wind, so that there appeared a sort of conflict of 
            the two elements fighting together. Thus, by the influence of <name>Martin</name>, the 
            fire only acted in the place where it was ordered to do so. But in a village 
            which was named <place>Leprosum</place>, when he too wished to overthrow a temple which had 
            acquired great wealth through the superstitious ideas entertained of its 
            sanctity, a multitude of the heathen resisted him to such a degree that he 
            was driven back not without bodily injury. He, therefore, withdrew to a place 
            in the vicinity, and there for three days, clothed in sackcloth[30] and ashes 
            fasting and praying the whole time, he besought the <name>Lord</name>, that, as he had not 
            been able to overthrow that temple by human effort, Divine power might be 
            exerted to destroy it. Then two angels, with spears and shields after the 
            manner of heavenly warriors, suddenly presented themselves to him, saying 
            that they were sent by the <name>Lord</name> to put to flight the rustic multitude, and 
            to furnish protection to <name>Martin</name>, lest, while the temple was being destroyed, 
            any one should offer resistance. They told him therefore to return, and complete 
            the blessed work which he had begun. Accordingly <name>Martin</name> returned to the village; 
            and while the crowds of heathen looked on in perfect quiet as he razed the pagan 
            temple even to the foundations, he also reduced all the altars and images to dust. 
            At this sight the rustics, when they perceived that they had been so astounded 
            and terrified by an intervention of the Divine will, that they might not be found 
            fighting against the bishop, almost all believed in the <name>Lord Jesus</name>. They then began 
            to cry out openly and to confess that the God of <name>Martin</name> ought to be worshiped, and 
            that the idols should be despised, which were not able to help them.</Heading0>

    </row>
    <row>
        <Heading0>I SHALL also relate what took place in the <place>village of the Ædui</place>. 
            When <name>Martin</name> was there overthrowing a temple, a multitude of rustic heathen 
            rushed upon him in a frenzy of rage. And when one of them, bolder than the rest, 
            made an attack upon him with a drawn sword, <name>Martin</name>, throwing back his cloak, 
            offered his bare neck to the assassin. Nor did the heathen delay to strike, but 
            in the very act of lifting up his right arm, he fell to the ground on his back, 
            and being overwhelmed by the fear of <name>God</name>, he entreated for pardon. Not unlike 
            this was that other event which happened to <name>Martin</name>, that when a certain man had 
            resolved to wound him with a knife as he was destroying some idols, at the very 
            moment of fetching the blow, the weapon was struck out of his hands and disappeared. 
            Very frequently, too, when the pagans were addressing him to the effect that he 
            would not overthrow their temples, he so soothed and conciliated the minds of the 
            heathen by his holy discourse that, the light of truth having been revealed to them, 
            they themselves overthrew their own temples.</Heading0>

        <Heading0>Cures effected by <name>St. Martin</name>.</Heading0>
    </row>
    <row>
        <Heading0>MOREOVER, the gift[31] of accomplishing cures was so largely possessed 
            by <name>Martin</name>, that scarcely any sick person came to him for assistance without 
            being at once restored to health. This will clearly appear from the following 
            example. A certain girl at <place>Treves</place>[32] was so completely prostrated by a terrible 
            paralysis that for a long time she had been quite unable to make use of her body 
            for any purpose, and being, as it were, already dead, only the smallest breath of 
            life seemed still to remain in her. Her afflicted relatives were standing by, 
            expecting nothing but her death, when it was suddenly announced that <name>Martin</name> had 
            come to that city. When the father of the girl found that such was the case, he 
            ran to make a request in behalf of his all but lifeless child. It happened that 
            <name>Martin</name> had already entered the church. There, while the people were looking on, 
            and in the presence of many other bishops, the old man, uttering a cry of grief, 
            embraced the saint's knees and said: "My daughter is dying of a miserable kind of 
            infirmity; and, what is more dreadful than death itself, she is now alive only in 
            the spirit, her flesh being already dead before the time. I beseech thee to go to 
            her, and give her thy blessing; for I believe that through you she will be restored 
            to health." <name>Martin</name>, troubled by such an address, was bewildered, and shrank back, 
            saying that this was a matter not in his own hands; that the old man was mistaken 
            in the judgment he had formed; and that he was not worthy to be the instrument 
            through whom the <name>Lord</name> should make a display of his power. The father, in tears, 
            persevered in still more earnestly pressing the case, and entreated <name>Martin</name> to visit 
            the dying girl. At last, constrained by the bishops standing by to go as requested, 
            he went down to the home of the girl. An immense crowd was waiting at the doors, 
            to see what the servant of the <name>Lord</name> would do. And first, betaking himself to his 
            familiar arms in affairs of that kind, he cast himself down on the ground and prayed. 
            Then gazing earnestly upon the ailing girl, he requests that oil should be given him. 
            After he had received and blessed this, he poured the powerful sacred liquid into the 
            mouth of the girl, and immediately her voice returned to her. Then gradually, through 
            contact with him, her limbs began, one by one, to recover life, till, at last, in the 
            presence of the people, she arose with firm steps.</Heading0>

    <row>
        <Heading0>AT the same time the servant of one <name>Tetradius</name>, a man of proconsular rank, 
            having been laid hold of by a demon, was tormented with the most miserable results. 
            <name>Martin</name>, therefore, having been asked to lay his hands on him, ordered the servant to 
            be brought to him; but the evil spirit could, in no way, be brought forth from the cell 
            in which he was: he showed himself so fearful, with ferocious teeth, to those who attempted 
            to draw near. Then <name>Tetradius</name> throws himself at the feet of the saintly man, imploring that 
            he himself would go down to the house in which the possessed of the devil was kept. But 
            <name>Martin</name> then declared that he could not visit the house of an unconverted heathen. For <name>Tetradius</name>, 
            at that time, was still involved in the errors of heathenism. He, therefore, pledges his word 
            that if the demon were driven out of the boy, he would become a Christian. <name>Martin</name>, then, laying 
            his hand upon the boy, cast the evil spirit out of him. On seeing this, <name>Tetradius</name> believed in the 
            <name>Lord Jesus</name>, and immediately became a catechumen, while, not long after, he was baptized; and he 
            always regarded <name>Martin</name> with extraordinary affection, as having been the author of his salvation.</Heading0>

    <row>
        <Heading0>About the same time, having entered the dwelling of a certain householder in the same town, 
            he stopped short at the very threshold, and said, that he perceived a horrible demon in the courtyard 
            of the house. When <name>Martin</name> ordered it to depart, it laid hold of a certain member of the family, who 
            was staying in the inner part of the house; and the poor wretch began at once to rage with his teeth, 
            and to lacerate whomsoever he met. The house was thrown into disorder; the family was in confusion; 
            and the people present took to flight. <name>Martin</name> threw himself in the way of the frenzied creature, 
            and first of all commanded him to stand still. But when he continued to gnash with his teeth, and, 
            with gaping mouth, was threatening to bite, <name>Martin</name> inserted his fingers into his mouth, and said, 
            "If you possess any power, devour these." But then, as if red-hot iron had entered his jaws, drawing 
            his teeth far away he took care not to touch the fingers of the saintly man; and when he was compelled 
            by punishments and tortures, to flee out of the possessed body, while he had no power of escaping by the 
            mouth, he was cast out by means of a defluxion of the belly, leaving disgusting traces behind him.</Heading0>

        <Heading0>IN the meanwhile, as a sudden report had troubled <place>the city</place> as to the movement 
            and inroad of the barbarians, <name>Martin</name> orders a possessed person to be set before him, 
            and commanded him to declare whether this message was true or not. Then he confessed 
            that there were sixteen demons who had spread this report among the people, in order 
            that by the fear thus excited, <name>Martin</name> might have to flee from the city, but that, in 
            fact, nothing was less in the minds of the barbarians than to make any inroad. When 
            the unclean spirit thus acknowledged these things in the midst of the church, the city 
            was set free from the fear and tumult which had at the time been felt.</Heading0>

        <Heading0>At <place>Paris</place>, again, when <name>Martin</name> was entering the gate of the city, with large 
            crowds attending him, he gave a kiss to a leper, of miserable appearance, while 
            all shuddered at seeing him do so; and <name>Martin</name> blessed him, with the result that 
            he was instantly cleansed from all his misery. On the following day, the man 
            appearing in the church with a healthy skin, gave thanks for the soundness of body 
            which he had recovered. This fact, too, ought not to be passed over in silence, that 
            threads from <name>Martin</name>'s garment, or such as had been plucked from the sackcloth which 
            he wore, wrought frequent miracles upon those who were sick. For, by either being 
            tied round the fingers or placed about the neck, they very often drove away 
            diseases from the afflicted.</Heading0>

        <Heading0>FURTHER, <name>Arborius</name>, an ex-prefect, and a man of a very holy and faithful

            inserted in the bosom of the girl, at the very paroxysm of the heat, a letter of <name>Martin</name> 
            which happened to have been brought to him, and immediately the fever was dispelled. 
            This event had such an influence upon <name>Arborius</name>, that he at once consecrated the girl to <name>God</name>, 
            and devoted her to perpetual virginity. Then, proceeding to <name>Martin</name>, he presented the girl 
            to him, as an obvious living example of his power of working miracles, inasmuch as she had 
            been cured by him though absent; and he would not suffer her to be consecrated by any other 
            than <name>Martin</name>, through his placing upon her the dress characteristic of virginity.</Heading0>

            having grown over it had already covered up its pupil, <name>Martin</name> touched his eye with a 
            painter's brush, and, all pain being removed, thus restored it to its former soundness. 
            He himself also, when, by a certain accident, he had fallen out of an upper room, and 
            tumbling down a broken, uneven stair, had received many wounds, as he lay in his cell 
            at the point of death, and was tortured with grievous sufferings, saw in the night an 
            angel appear to him, who washed his wounds, and applied healing ointment to the bruised 
            members of his body. As the effect of this, he found himself on the morrow restored to 
            soundness of health, so that he was not thought to have suffered any harm. But because 
            it would be tedious to go through everything of this kind, let these examples suffice, 
            as a few out of a multitude; and let it be enough that we do not in striking cases

        <Heading0>How <name>Martin</name> acted towards the <name>Emperor Maximus</name>.</Heading0>
    </row>
    <row>
        <Heading0>AND here to insert some smaller matters among things so great (although such is 
            the nature of our times in which all things have fallen into decay and corruption, it 
            is almost a pre-eminent virtue for priestly firmness not to have yielded to royal flattery), 
            when a number of bishops from various parts had assembled to the <name>Emperor Maximus</name>, a man of 
            fierce character, and at that time elated with the victory he had won in the civil wars, 
            and when the disgraceful flattery of all around the emperor was generally remarked, while 
            the priestly dignity had, with degenerate submissiveness, taken a second place to the royal 
            retinue, in <name>Martin</name> alone, apostolic authority continued to assert itself. For even if he had 
            to make suit to the sovereign for some things, he commanded rather than entreated him; and 
            although often invited, he kept away from his entertainments, saying that he could not take 
            a place at the table of one who, out of two emperors, had deprived one of his kingdom, and 
            the other of his life. At last, when <name>Maximus</name> maintained that he had not of his own accord 
            assumed the sovereignty, but that he had simply defended by arms the necessary requirements[34] 
            of the empire, regard to which had been imposed upon him by the soldiers, according to the Divine 
            appointment, and that the favor of <name>God</name> did not seem wanting to him who, by an event seemingly 
            so incredible, had secured the victory, adding to that the statement that none of his adversaries 
            had been slain except in the open field of battle, at length, <name>Martin</name>, overcome either by his 
            reasoning or his entreaties, came to the royal banquet. The king was wonderfully pleased because 
            he had gained this point. Moreover, there were guests present who had been invited as if to a 
            festival; men of the highest and most illustrious rank,--the prefect, who was also consul, named 
            <name>Evodius</name>, one of the most righteous men that ever lived; two courtiers possessed of the greatest 
            power, the brother and uncle of the king, while between these two, the presbyter of <name>Martin</name> had 
            taken his place; but he himself occupied a seat which was set quite close to the king. About the 
            middle of the banquet, according to custom, one of the servants presented a goblet to the king. 
            He orders it rather to be given to the very holy bishop, expecting and hoping that he should then 
            receive the cup from his right hand. But <name>Martin</name>, when he had drunk, handed the goblet to his own 
            presbyter, as thinking no one worthier to drink next to himself, and holding that it would, not 
            be right for him to prefer either the king himself, or those who were next the king, to the presbyter. 
            And the emperor, as well as all those who were then present, admired this conduct so much, that this 
            very thing, by which they had been undervalued, gave them pleasure. The report then ran through the 
            whole palace that <name>Martin</name> had done, at the king's dinner, what no bishop had dared to do at the banquets 
            of the lowest judges. And <name>Martin</name> predicted to the same <name>Maximus</name> long before, that if he went into Italy 
            to which he then desired to go, waging war, against the <name>Emperor Valentinianus</name>, it would come to pass 
            that he should know he would[35] indeed be victorious in the first attack, but would perish a short 
            time afterwards. And we have seen that this did in fact take place. For, on his first arrival 
            <name>Valentinianus</name> had to betake himself to flight but recovering his strength about a year afterwards, 
            <name>Maximus</name> was taken and slain by him within the walls of <place>Aquileia</place>.</Heading0>

    </row>
    <row>
        <Heading0>IT is also well known that angels were very often seen by him, so that they 
            spoke in turns with him in set speech. As to the <name>devil</name>, <name>Martin</name> held him so visible 
            and ever under the power of his eyes, that whether he kept himself in his proper form, 
            or changed himself into different shapes of spiritual wickedness, he was perceived by <name>Martin</name>, 
            under whatever guise he appeared. The <name>devil</name> knew well that he could not escape discovery, 
            and therefore frequently heaped insults upon Martin, being unable to beguile him by trickery. 
            On one occasion the <name>devil</name>, holding in his hand the bloody horn of an ox, rushed into <name>Martin</name>'s 
            cell with great noise, and holding out to him his bloody right hand, while at the same time he 
            exulted in the crime he had committed, said: "Where, O <name>Martin</name>, is thy power? I have just slain 
            one of your people." Then <name>Martin</name> assembled the brethren, and related to them what the <name>devil</name> had 
            disclosed, while he ordered them carefully to search the several cells in order to discover who 
            had been visited with this calamity. They report that no one of the monks was missing, but that 
            one peasant, hired by them, had gone to the forest to bring home wood in his wagon. Upon hearing 
            this, <name>Martin</name> instructs some of them to go and meet him. On their doing so, the man was found 
            almost dead at no great distance from the monastery. Nevertheless, although just drawing his 
            last breath, he made known to the brethren the cause of his wound and death. He said that, while 
            he was drawing tighter the thongs which had got loose on the oxen yoked together, one of the oxen, 
            throwing his head free, had wounded him with his horn in the groin. And not long after the man 
            expired. You[36] see with what judgment of the <name>Lord</name> this power was given to the <name>devil</name>. This was 
            a marvelous feature in <name>Martin</name> that not only on this occasion to which I have specially referred, 
            but on many occasions of the same kind, in fact as often as such things occurred, he perceived 
            them long beforehand, and[37] disclosed the things which had been revealed to him to the brethren.</Heading0>

    <row>
        <Heading0>NOW, the <name>devil</name>, while he tried to impose upon the holy man by a thousand injurious 
            arts, often thrust himself upon him in a visible form, but in very various shapes. For 
            sometimes he presented himself to his view changed into the person of <name>Jupiter</name>, often into 
            that of <name>Mercury</name> and <name>Minerva</name>. Often, too, were heard words of reproach, in which the crowd 
            of demons assailed <name>Martin</name> with scurrilous expressions. But knowing that all were false and 
            groundless, he was not affected by the charges brought against him. Moreover, some of the 
            brethren bore witness that they had heard a demon reproaching <name>Martin</name> in abusive terms, and 
            asking why he had taken back, on their subsequent repentance, certain of the brethren who had, 
            some time previously, lost their baptism by falling into various errors. The demon set forth 
            the crimes of each of them; but they added that <name>Martin</name>, resisting the <name>devil</name> firmly, answered 
            him, that by-past sins are cleansed away by the leading of a better life, and that through the 
            mercy of <name>God</name>, those are to be absolved from their sins who have given up their evil ways. The 
            <name>devil</name> saying in opposition to this that such guilty men as those referred to did not come 
            within the pale of pardon, and that no mercy was extended by the <name>Lord</name> to those who had once 
            fallen away, <name>Martin</name> is said to have cried out in words to the following effect: "If thou, 
            thyself, wretched being, wouldst but desist from attacking mankind, and even, at this period,
            when the day of judgment is at hand, wouldst only repent of your deeds, I, with a true confidence
            in the <name>Lord</name>, would promise you the mercy of <name>Christ</name>."[38] O what a holy boldness with respect to 
            the loving-kindness of the <name>Lord</name>, in which, although he could not assert authority, he nevertheless 
            showed the feelings dwelling within him! And since our discourse has here sprung up concerning 
            the devil and his devices, it does not seem away from the point, although the matter does not 
            bear immediately upon <name>Martin</name>, to relate what took place; both because the virtues of <name>Martin</name> do, 
            to some extent, appear in the transaction, and the incident, which was worthy of a miracle, 
            will properly be put on record, with the view of furnishing a caution, should anything of a 
            similar character subsequently occur.</Heading0>

    <row>
        <Heading0>A Case of Diabolic Deception.</Heading0>
    </row>
    <row>
        <Heading0>THERE was a certain man, <name>Clarus</name> by name, a most noble youth, who afterwards became a presbyter, 
            and who is now, through his happy departure from this world, numbered among the saints. He, leaving 
            all others, betook himself to <name>Martin</name>, and in a short time became distinguished for the most exalted 
            faith, and for all sorts of excellence. Now, it came to pass that, when he had erected an abode for 
            himself not far from the monastery of the bishop, and many brethren were staying with him, a certain 
            youth, <name>Anatolius</name> by name, having, under the profession of a monk, falsely assumed every appearance 
            of humility and innocence, came to him, and lived for some time on the common store along with the 
            rest. Then, as time went on, he began to affirm that angels were in the habit of talking with him. 
            As no one gave any credit to his words, he urged a number of the brethren to believe by certain signs. 
            At length he went to such a length as to declare that angels passed between him and <name>God</name>; and now he 
            wished that he should be regarded as one of the prophets. <name>Clarus</name>, however, could by no means be induced 
            to believe. He then began to threaten <name>Clarus</name> with the anger of <name>God</name> and present afflictions, because 
            he did not believe one of the saints. At the last, he is related to have burst forth with the following 
            declaration: "Behold, the <name>Lord</name> will this night give me a white robe out of heaven, clothed in which, 
            I will dwell in the midst of you; and that will be to you a sign that I am the Power of <name>God</name>, 
            inasmuch as I have been presented with the garment of <name>God</name>." Then truly the expectation of all was 
            highly raised by this profession. Accordingly, about the middle of the night, it was seen, by the 
            noise of people moving eagerly about, that the whole monastery in the place was excited. It might be 
            seen, too, that the cell in which the young man referred to lived was glittering with numerous lights; 
            and the whisperings of those moving about in it, as well as a kind of murmur of many. voices, could be 
            heard. Then, on silence being secured, the youth coming forth calls one of the brethren, Sabatius by name, 
            to himself, and shows him the robe in which he had been clothed. He again, filled with amazement, gathers 
            the rest together, and <name>Clarus</name> himself also runs up; and a light being obtained, they all carefully inspect 
            the garment. Now, it was of the utmost softness, of marvelous brightness, and of glittering purple, and 
            yet no one could discover what was its nature, or of what sort of fleece it had been formed. However, 
            when it was more minutely examined by the eyes or fingers, it seemed nothing else than a garment. In 
            the meantime, <name>Clarus</name> urges upon the brethren to be earnest in prayer, that the <name>Lord</name> would show them 
            more clearly what it really was. Accordingly, the rest of the night was spent in singing hymns and 
            psalms. But when day broke, <name>Clarus</name> wished to take the young man by the hand, and bring him to <name>Martin</name>, 
            being well aware that he could not be deceived by any arts of the <name>devil</name>. Then, indeed, the miserable 
            man began to resist and refuse, and affirmed that he had been forbidden to show himself to <name>Martin</name>. 
            And when they compelled him to go against his will, the garment vanished from among the hands of 
            those who were conducting him. Wherefore, who can doubt that this, too, was an illustration of the 
            power of <name>Martin</name>, so that the devil could no longer dissemble or conceal his own deception, when it 
            was to be submitted to the eyes of <name>Martin</name>?</Heading0>

        <Heading0><name>Martin</name> is tempted by the Wiles of the <name>Devil</name>.</Heading0>
    </row>
    <row>
        <Heading0>IT was found, again, that about the same time there was a young man in <place>Spain</place>, 
            who, having by many signs obtained for himself authority among the people, was puffed 
            up to such a pitch that he gave himself out as being <name>Elias</name>. And when multitudes had 
            too readily believed this, he went on to say that he was actually <name>Christ</name>; and he succeeded 
            so well even in this delusion that a certain bishop named <name>Rufus</name> worshiped him as being the 
            <name>Lord</name>. For so doing, we have seen this bishop at a later date deprived of his office. 
            Many of the brethren have also informed me that at the same time one arose in the East, 
            who boasted that he was <name>John</name>. We may infer from this, since false prophets of such a kind 
            have appeared, that the coming of <name>Antichrist</name> is at hand; for he is already practicing in 
            these persons the mystery of iniquity. And truly I think this point should not be passed 
            over, with what arts the devil about this very time tempted <name>Martin</name>. For, on a certain day, 
            prayer[39] having been previously offered, and the fiend himself being surrounded by a purple 
            light, in order that he might the more easily deceive people by the brilliance of the splendor 
            assumed, clothed also in a royal robe, and with a crown of precious stones and gold encircling 
            his head, his shoes too being inlaid with gold, while he presented a tranquil countenance, and 
            a generally rejoicing aspect, so that no such thought as that he was the devil might be 
            entertained--he stood by the side of <name>Martin</name> as he was praying in his cell. The saint being 
            dazzled by his first appearance, both preserved a long and deep silence. This was first broken 
            by the <name>devil</name>, who said: "Acknowledge, <name>Martin</name>, who it is that you behold. I am <name>Christ</name>; and being 
            just about to descend to earth, I wished first to manifest myself to thee." When <name>Martin</name> kept 
            silence on hearing these words, and gave no answer whatever, the devil dared to repeat his 
            audacious declaration: "<name>Martin</name>, why do you hesitate to believe, when you see? I am <name>Christ</name>." 
            Then <name>Martin</name>, the <name>Spirit</name> revealing the truth to him, that he might understand it was the <name>devil</name>, 
            and not <name>God</name>, replied as follows: "The <name>Lord Jesus</name> did not predict that he would come clothed 
            in purple, and with a glittering crown upon his head. I will not believe that <name>Christ</name> has come, 
            unless he appears with that appearance and form in which he suffered, and openly displaying 
            the marks of his wounds upon the cross." On hearing these words, the <name>devil</name> vanished like smoke, 
            and filled the cell with such a disgusting smell, that he left unmistakable evidences of his real 
            character. This event, as I have just related, took place in the way which I have stated, and my 
            information regarding it was derived from the lips of <name>Martin</name> himself; therefore let no one regard 
            it as fabulous.[40]</Heading0>

        <Heading0>Intercourse of <name>Sulpitius</name> with <name>Martin</name>.</Heading0>
    </row>
    <row>
        <Heading0>FOR since I, having long heard accounts of his faith, life and virtues, burned with 
            a desire of knowing him, I undertook what was to me a pleasant journey for the purpose of 
            seeing him. At the same time, because already my mind was inflamed with the desire of writing 
            his life, I obtained my information partly from himself, in so far as I could venture to 
            question him, and partly from those who had lived with him, or well knew the facts of the case. 
            And at this time it is scarcely credible with what humility and with what kindness he received me; 
            while he cordially wished me joy, and rejoiced in the <name>Lord</name> that he had been held in such high 
            estimation by me that I had undertaken a journey owing to my desire of seeing him. Unworthy me! 
            (in fact, I hardly dare acknowledge it), that he should have deigned to admit me to fellowship 
            with him! He went so far as in person to present me with water to wash my hands, and at eventide 
            he himself washed my feet; nor had I sufficient courage to resist or oppose his doing so. In fact, 
            I felt so overcome by the authority he unconsciously exerted, that I deemed it unlawful to do 
            anything but acquiesce in his arrangements. His conversation with me was all directed to such points 
            as the following: that the allurements of this world and secular burdens were to be abandoned in order 
            that we might be free and unencumbered in following the <name>Lord Jesus</name>; and he pressed upon me as an 
            admirable example in present circumstances the conduct of that distinguished man <name>Paulinus</name>, of whom 
            I have made mention above. <name>Martin</name> declared of him that, by parting with his great possessions and 
            following <name>Christ</name>, as he did, he showed himself almost the only one who in these times had fully 
            obeyed the precepts of the Gospel. He insisted strongly that that was the man who should be made 
            the object of our imitation, adding that the present age was fortunate in possessing such a model 
            of faith and virtue. For <name>Paulinus</name>, being rich and having many possessions, by selling them all and 
            giving them to the poor according to the expressed will of the <name>Lord</name>, had, he said, made possible by 
            actual proof what appeared impossible of accomplishment. What power and dignity there were in <name>Martin</name>'s 
            words and conversation! How active he was, how practical, and how prompt and ready in solving questions 
            connected with Scripture! And because I know that many are incredulous on this point,--for indeed I have 
            met with persons who did not believe me when I related such things,--I call to witness <name>Jesus</name>, and our 
            common hope as Christians, that I never heard from any other lips than those of <name>Martin</name> such exhibitions 
            of knowledge and genius, or such specimens of good and pure speech. But yet, how insignificant is all 
            such praise when compared with the virtues which he possessed! Still, it is remarkable that in a man 
            who had no claim to be called learned, even this attribute [of high intelligence] was not wanting.</Heading0>

    </row>
    <row>
        <Heading0>BUT now my book must be brought to an end, and my discourse finished. This is 
            not because all that was worthy of being said concerning <name>Martin</name> is now exhausted, but 
            because I, just as sluggish poets grow less careful towards the end of their work, give 
            over, being baffled by the immensity of the matter. For, although his outward deeds could 
            in some sort of way be set forth in words, no language, I truly own, can ever be capable 
            of describing his inner life and daily conduct, and his mind always bent upon the things 
            of heaven. No one can adequately make known his perseverance and self-mastery in abstinence 
            and fastings, or his power in watchings and prayers, along with the nights, as well as days, 
            which were spent by him, while not a moment was separated from the service of <name>God</name>, either 
            for indulging in ease, or engaging in business. But, in fact, he did not indulge either 
            in food or sleep, except in so far as the necessities of nature required. I freely confess 
            that, if, as the saying is, <name>Homer</name> himself were to ascend from the shades below, he could 
            not do justice to this subject in words; to such an extent did all excellences surpass in 
            <name>Martin</name> the possibility of being embodied in language. Never did a single hour or moment 
            pass in which he was not either actually engaged in prayer; or, if it happened that he 
            was occupied with something else, still he never let his mind loose from prayer. In truth, 
            just as it is the custom of blacksmiths, in the midst of their work to beat their own anvil 
            as a sort of relief to the laborer, so <name>Martin</name> even when he appeared to be doing something 
            else, was still engaged in prayer. O truly blessed man in whom there was no guile--judging 
            no man, condemning no man, returning evil for evil to no man! He displayed indeed such 
            marvelous patience in the endurance of injuries, that even when he was chief[41] priest, 
            he allowed himself to be wronged by the lowest clerics with impunity; nor did he either 
            remove them from the office on account of such conduct, or, as far as in him lay, repel 
            them from a place in his affection.</Heading0>

        <Heading0>Wonderful Piety of <name>Martin</name>.</Heading0>
    </row>
    <row>
        <Heading0>NO one ever saw him enraged, or excited, or lamenting, or laughing; he was always 
            one and the same: displaying a kind of heavenly happiness in his countenance, he seemed 
            to have passed the ordinary limits of human nature. Never was there any word on his lips 
            but <name>Christ</name>, and never was there a feeling in his heart except piety, peace, and tender 
            mercy. Frequently, too, he used to weep for the sins of those who showed themselves his 
            revilers--those who, as he led his retired and tranquil life, slandered him with poisoned 
            tongue and a viper's mouth. And truly we have had experience of some who were envious of 
            his virtues and his life--who really hated in him what they did not see in themselves, 
            and what they had not power to imitate. And--O wickedness worthy of deepest grief and 
            groans!--some of his calumniators, although very few, some of his maligners, I say, were 
            reported to be no others than bishops! Here, however, it is not necessary to name any one, 
            although a good many of these people are still venting[42] their spleen against myself. I 
            shall deem it sufficient that, if any one of them reads this account, and perceives that 
            he is himself pointed at, he may have the grace to blush. But if, on the other hand, he 
            shows anger, he will, by that very fact, own that he is among those spoken of, though all 
            the time perhaps I have been thinking of some other person. I shall, however, by no means 
            feel ashamed if any people of that sort include myself in their hatred along with such a 
            man as <name>Martin</name>. I am quite persuaded of this, that the present little work will give pleasure 
            to all truly good men. And I shall only say further that, if any one read this narrative in 
            an unbelieving spirit, he himself will fall into sin. I am conscious to myself that I have 
            been induced by belief in the facts, and by the love of <name>Christ</name>, to write these things; and 
            that, in doing so, I have set forth what is well known, and recorded what is true; and, as 
            I trust, that man will have a reward prepared by <name>God</name>, not who shall read these things but 
            who shall believe them.[43]</Heading0>
